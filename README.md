Project stm32f103c8t6
---------------------

This is the source code for the book:

Beginning STM32 : Developing with FreeRTOS, libopencm3 and GCC

    ISBN: 978-1-4842-3623-9 Soft cover
          978-1-4842-3624-6 eBook

This git repo contains libopencm3 and FreeRTOS+libopencm3 projects.
This provides a ready development environment for those who want to
apply the economical STM32F103 to using libopencm3 alone or in
concert with FreeRTOS.

THIS PROJECT ONLY USES OPEN SOURCE TOOLS
----------------------------------------

No Windows based IDE environments are used or implied! Cygwin, Linux,
MacOS and *BSD environments are suitable.

This project exists to bring several components together in a manner
that just works for the STM32F103.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
------------------

The top level defines the environment common to libopencm3 mainly, and
used by FreeRTOS builds in the ./rtos subdirectory.

At the top level directory, projects like ./miniblink use libopencm3
only (they do NOT use FreeRTOS).

The subdirectory ./rtos contains projects that do use FreeRTOS (and
libopencm3).

PREREQUISITES:
--------------

    0a. It will be assumed here that you have your cross compiler
        toolchain installed. In Makefile.incl you'll see references
        to a PREFIX variable. This defaults to arm-none-eabi so that
        gcc for example will be arm-none-eabi-gcc etc. If your 
        prefix differs, edit Makefile.incl at the top level to
        match, or use the shell: export PREFIX=whatever

    0b. It is also assumed that you have the st-link command installed
        on your system. You may need to download and install it. 
        Google is your friend.

    1.  If you didn't use a --recursive git clone, then you need to make
        sure that libopencm3 is fetched now. From the top level apply
        one of:

            $ git submodule update --init --recursive   # First time

            $ git submodule update --recursive          # Subsequent

    2.  Go into ./libopencm3 and type "make". This should build the 
        static libraries that will be needed. Any issues there should
        go to the libopencm3 community.

    3.  For FreeRTOS, cd into ./rtos and unzip your FreeRTOS download
        there. It should create a subdirectory FreeRTOSv10.0.0 or 
        similar. If the release differs, you'll need to change the
        variable assignment in rtos/Project.mk FREERTOS ?= ....
        to match, or use the shell: export FREERTOS=whatever

    4.  Do NOT compile FreeRTOS, since portions of it will be copied
        to your project subdirectory for further customization. Each
        project is capable of running a different FreeRTOS configuration.

    5.  At the top level, do a "make" so that the libwwg and other
        projects get built.  Do a "make clobber" first, if you need
        to rebuild.

    All of this is explained in detail in the book.

TEST EXAMPLES:
--------------

After the prerequisites have been met:

Going into ./miniblink and:

    $ make
    $ make flash

should build and flash your example program. Flashing assumes the
use of the st-link (v2) command.

Or go into ./rtos/blink:

    $ make
    $ make flash

will build your FreeRTOS blink example.

If you are encountering make errors, then try forcing the use
of Gnu make (it may be installed as "gmake").

CREATING NEW FreeRTOS PROJECTS:
-------------------------------

    1. cd ./rtos
    2. make -f Project.mk PROJECT=name
    3. cd ./name
    4. Tweak and build

See ./rtos/README.md for more details.

Notes:
======

1. When compiling and you get the error message getline.c:5:20: fatal error: memory.h: No such file or directory, at the line where it is coded as "#include <memory.h>", you may have to change that to "#include <string.h>" instead. The compiler folks have sometimes moved the header file.

1. It has been reported that: Kubuntu 18.04 ships with arm-none-eabi-gcc (15:6.3.1+svn253039-1build1) 6.3.1 20170620, with this compiler the code does not work (creates problems for FreeRTOS). memcpy seems to be the problematic function call in the code, it is called by FreeRTOS when adding an element to the queue. (details in the FreeRTOS discussion on SourceForge)
